To set up branches on your PC for managing different versions of your webpage, you can follow these steps:

1. **Initialize a Git Repository (if not already initialized):**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to your project directory using `cd path/to/your/project`.
   - Initialize the Git repository:
     ```bash
     git init
     ```

2. **Create and Switch to a New Branch:**
   - Create a new branch for your temporary webpage:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b temporary-page
     ```

3. **Replace the Content of `index.html` with `pre-tournament.html`:**
   - Copy the content of `pre-tournament.html` to `index.html`:
     ```bash
     cp pre-tournament.html index.html
     ```

4. **Commit the Changes:**
   - Stage and commit the changes:
     ```bash
     git add index.html
     git commit -m "Temporarily replace index.html with pre-tournament.html"
     ```

5. **Push the New Branch to the Remote Repository:**
   - Push the new branch to your remote repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin temporary-page
     ```

6. **Switch Back to the `main` Branch:**
   - Switch back to the `main` branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     ```

7. **Deploy the `temporary-page` Branch:**
   - Deploy the `temporary-page` branch to your web server or hosting provider to make the temporary `index.html` live.

When you are ready to revert back to your original `index.html`, you can switch back to the `main` branch and deploy it:

1. **Switch Back to the `main` Branch:**
   - Switch back to the `main` branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     ```

2. **Deploy the `main` Branch:**
   - Deploy the `main` branch to your web server or hosting provider to make the original `index.html` live again.

This way, you can easily manage different versions of your webpage using branches in Git.
